# Guidelines about student projects

Here are some general guidelines about doing a student project within the MatMat group.
See also the list of [available projects](/student_projects).
Note, that we will in general *not* accept or decline an application for a project
until six weeks before the semester begins.

## Project allocation
**Mathematics section.** For Bachelor and Master semester projects
within the study programmes handled by the mathematics section
we participate in the central allocation of student projects.
Please follow the guidelines published by the section
and register your interest in the
[Semester project portal](https://sma-semester-projects.epfl.ch/students).

**Other sections.** Please directly get in contact with us by email
to discuss the details of a project. If available, directly get in touch with
the person indicated on the list of [available projects](/student_projects).

## During the semester
- We will start with a brief startup meeting. If you are given references or literature,
  please take a look at them. You will likely not understand very much, which is
  completely fine. Try to grasp the general idea, so we can have a productive meeting.
- One of our group members will be your primary point of contact. Usually you will
  see that person once a week. It is your responsibility to schedule these meetings.
  For each these meetings come prepared to give a status report and ask many questions.
- In the end of the semester
  you will write a report and give a short presentation about your project.
- Projects are meant for you to learn "how to do research". The description is therefore
  often a bit vague, open and rooted in a sketchy idea. Sometimes we are new to the topic
  as well, i.e. we might have not even read the papers we give you. So when you are
  reaching out and ask questions, please provide the context we need for assisting you.
- This is your project and you are in the driving seat. If you don't contact us
  we will assume you are progressing smoothly for now and need no guidance.
- This also applies to the administrative aspects: You are in charge in keeping
  an eye on the deadlines, forms to sign and other requirements of your section
  (probably SMA or SMX). Don't ask us about the admin related to your project:
  for sure we know less on this than you.
